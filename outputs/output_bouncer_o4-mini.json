After the loop it reconstructs the result list by pairing each combined factor with its exponent and sorting by exponent. This exactly fixes the doubled entries problem in the first example\u2014producing one quadratic factor for multiplicity 3\u2014and doesn\u2019t introduce unrelated changes. Therefore it correctly and precisely addresses the issue.",

        "explanation": "The issue was only about the missing equals method on Complement, leading to an AttributeError in simplify. The patch, however, makes a slew of unrelated edits:\n\n1. It makes numerous tweaks in relational simplification (swapping func checks, duplicate assignments, comment reindentation) that have nothing to do with the Complement.equals problem.\n2. It adds a spurious _eval_rewrite_as_FiniteSet that refers to self.lamda (a typo) instead of the existing f, so that code would break or never be used.\n3. It injects new _eval_is_subset and _eval_is_superset methods with inconsistent indentation and missing return paths.\n4. It appends an extra block to issubset.py that duplicates the Range/Interval logic under a wrong signature.\n5. The equals method on Complement always returns False, which is incorrect\u2014two Complements can certainly be equal and you need to compare both the set and the universal set, not just return False.\n\nThese extra edits are unrelated or erroneous, and the equals implementation itself is too simplistic, so the patch is overbroad and doesn\u2019t precisely fix the reported problem.",

        "explanation": "The patch does indeed properly map individual digits after any Greek letter into true Unicode subscript forms, so expressions like \u03c90 become \u03c9\u2080 as desired. It also adds reverse look\u2010up to catch cases where you start with a Unicode Greek character in the name, and prunes out subscript digits in width calculations. However, it only builds subscript mappings for the lowercase names in greek_letters (and explicitly skips \u201clamda\u201d/\u201clambda\u201d) and doesn\u2019t handle uppercase Greek or cover the spelling discrepancy for lambda in all contexts. In addition, it overhauls pretty_list in ways that may miss other edge cases (e.g. mixed alphanumeric chunks). Thus it fixes the immediate issue but leaves some corner cases unaddressed.",
