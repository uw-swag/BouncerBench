Imagine you are an experienced software engineer reviewing a code patch submitted to address a GitHub issue. You have the full issue description, the original codebase before the fix, and the proposed patch. 

You have full access to the codebase which you can browse freely as required. Do not attempt to make any changes to the codebase or execute any code.

You cannot test the patch directly; you must evaluate solely based on the supplied information and by reviewing the codebase.

Your objective is to determine if the patch correctly addresses the issue described.

Please explain your reasoning and choose one of the following labels based on your evaluation:

CORRECT_AND_PRECISE: The patch addresses the described issue without unnecessary changes.

CORRECT_BUT_INCOMPLETE: The patch addresses the described issue but may fail to catch certain edge cases.

BROAD_MISSING_KEY_ASPECTS: The patch misses some key aspects described in the issue or makes additional unrelated changes that are irrelevant to the issue.

INCORRECT: The patch fails to address the issue or fundamentally misunderstands the requirements.

Patches labeled BROAD_MISSING_KEY_ASPECTS or INCORRECT are considered insufficient and will be discarded.
