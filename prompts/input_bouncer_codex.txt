Imagine that you are an experienced software engineer who has been instructed to create a PR that successfully resolves the GitHub issue supplied. 

You have full access to the codebase which you can browse freely as required. Do not attempt to make any changes to the codebase or execute any code.

Your objective is to determine if the issue description is well-specified enough for a meaningful attempt at a solution?

Please explain your choice and pick one of the following labels based on your analysis:

WELL_SPECIFIED: The issue is well-specified and it is clear what is required for a successful solution.

REASONABLY_SPECIFIED: There are some blanks to fill in about the issue, but there is a sensible interpretation of what is required for a successful solution.

VAGUE: The issue is vague and there is room for ambiguity. It is unclear what a successful solution would look like.

IMPOSSIBLE_TO_SOLVE: It is almost impossible to understand what you are being asked to do without further information

Tickets that are labeled VAGUE and IMPOSSIBLE_TO_SOLVE will be considered not specified enough for an attempt at a solution and discarded
