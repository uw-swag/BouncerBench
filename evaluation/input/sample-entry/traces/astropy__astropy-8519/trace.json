  "trace": "The report includes a minimal reproducible example with input code, observed behavior, error messages, and a clear statement of the expected behavior (that operations on two ABmag quantities should yield an ABmag result). The scope of the change\u2014preserving the magnitude system when adding or subtracting ABmag Quantities\u2014is unambiguous. This is well-specified for a meaningful fix."
