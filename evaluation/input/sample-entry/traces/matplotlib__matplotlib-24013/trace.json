  "trace": "The issue is more of a design discussion than a concrete bug or feature with clear acceptance criteria. It proposes renaming modules (e.g. tripcolor \u2192 _tripcolor) to avoid name collisions, but doesn\u2019t specify the full scope, migration path, or final behavior. There\u2019s no clear \u201cdone\u201d state or code change instructions, making it too vague for an immediate implementation."
