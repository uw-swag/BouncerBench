  "trace": "The report clearly identifies that Contains.as_set wrongly returns a Contains object (a Boolean) rather than a Set, causing failures when code expects a Set with as_relational. You can reasonably infer that as_set should return the second argument (the Set operand) so that .as_relational(x) works again (e.g. Contains(x, S.Reals).as_set() \u2192 S.Reals). While the exact return value isn\u2019t spelled out in prose, it\u2019s straightforward to implement once you know the Sympy as_set convention, so this ticket is reasonably specified."
