  "trace": "The report clearly describes the actual vs expected behavior, the form setup (ModelChoiceField with `disabled=True` and an initial value), the error seen on submit, and even points to a related Django bug.

There\u2019s enough context to produce a reasonable patch or workaround, so this is REASONABLY_SPECIFIED."
