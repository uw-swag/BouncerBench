  "trace": "The issue gives concrete failing examples (2*x**2 + y**2 - 16 and 10*x**2 + 12*x*y + 12*y**2 - 34), shows actual vs expected outputs, and pinpoints the elliptic\u2010case solver as the suspect. While it doesn\u2019t prescribe the exact code change, it\u2019s clear what behavior must be fixed and tested. Therefore it\u2019s adequately specified for a meaningful implementation attempt."
