  "trace": "The report points to an exact file and line number, describes that `args[0]` will throw an IndexError on an empty linsolve result, and even cites the specific failing test. It doesn\u2019t spell out the exact desired behavior in that branch (e.g. return an empty ImageSet, raise a specific error, etc.), but there\u2019s enough context to write a patch (check for emptiness before accessing `args[0]`, adjust the handling accordingly). Hence it\u2019s reasonably specified."
