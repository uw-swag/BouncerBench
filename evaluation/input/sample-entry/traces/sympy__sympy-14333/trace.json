  "trace": "The issue clearly states the current behavior, the desired mathematical conventions (range [0, m) for m>0 and (m, 0] for m<0), cites examples from WolframAlpha, and provides expected outputs for all sign combinations. It\u2019s straightforward to implement: remove the m>1 guard for m<0, compute the inverse via extended GCD, then normalize the result into the specified interval. All requirements and examples are given."
