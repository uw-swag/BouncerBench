  "trace": "The issue clearly demonstrates a lack of left\u2010side dispatch in Poly multiplication with examples and expected behavior (i.e. x*Poly(x) should give Poly(x**2), S(-2)*Poly(x) should give Poly(-2*x), etc.). While it doesn\u2019t prescribe exactly where in the code to fix it, the problem and desired outcome are unambiguous, making it straightforward to implement a __rmul__ or adjust the dispatch logic. Thus it\u2019s reasonably specified."
