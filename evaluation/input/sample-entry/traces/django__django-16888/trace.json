  "trace": "The report clearly describes the bug, provides a minimal failing test case, shows a full stack trace, and lays out the intended behavior (either swallow the InvalidOperation and return DoesNotExist or else supply a more specific error). While there is a small design choice to make (which of the two behaviors to implement), there is more than enough detail to write a targeted fix and add the provided test to the suite. Hence it is reasonably specified."
