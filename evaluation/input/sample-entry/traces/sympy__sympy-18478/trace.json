  "trace": "The issue as written is more of a user question about why two different expressions yield different substitution results in Sympy rather than a clear bug report or feature request with expected behavior, input/output examples, version details, and reproduction steps. It lacks a precise statement of what needs to be changed or fixed and what the correct behavior should be, so it\u2019s too vague to implement a meaningful solution or PR."
