  "trace": "The issue clearly identifies a memory bottleneck in the IsolationForest\u2019s decision_function (specifically in its loop that builds full n_samples\u00d7n_trees arrays) and suggests refactoring so that per\u2010tree scores are aggregated incrementally rather than stored in large intermediate matrices. The problematic code is pinpointed (lines 267\u2013281 in iforest.py), the repro is described, and a high\u2010level solution (move average_path_length logic into each tree\u2019s scoring to avoid full-array accumulation) is sketched. While implementation details and benchmarks are not given, there\u2019s enough concrete context\u2014file locations, code snippets, and performance goal\u2014to make a meaningful attempt at a fix. Thus, it is REASONABLY_SPECIFIED."
