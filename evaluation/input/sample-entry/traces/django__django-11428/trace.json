  "trace": "The report clearly outlines how to reproduce the error, the root cause (raise_last_exception attempts to reinstantiate a custom\u2010signature exception with only one arg), and its regression point. It doesn\u2019t prescribe an exact fix (e.g. fallback to original exception when signature mismatch), but there\u2019s an obvious, practical way forward. This makes the issue reasonably specified for someone to implement a solution."
