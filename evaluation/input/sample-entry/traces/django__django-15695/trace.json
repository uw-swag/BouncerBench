  "trace": "The issue clearly describes a bug in Django\u2019s RenameIndex migration operation when handling autogenerated (unnamed) index names for unique_together constraints. It shows the failing test, the error, and the desired behavior (that database_backwards should restore the old autogenerated name so that database_forwards can be re-applied without conflict). While you\u2019d need to dive into the RenameIndex code to see exactly how names are stored and reversed, the expected fix (renaming back to the original autogenerated name) is unambiguous. Therefore, it\u2019s reasonably specified for a Django core contributor to implement."
