  "trace": "The report clearly states the exact symptoms (migrations not detected when the filename contains dots), provides minimal reproduction steps and code, shows expected vs. actual behavior, includes a sample repo and even proposed fixes (renaming the file, changing the constraint name, or patching Django).
