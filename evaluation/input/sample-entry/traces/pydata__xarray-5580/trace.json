  "trace": "The issue clearly identifies where the change is needed (the default `display_max_rows` in `xr.set_options()`), why it\u2019s a problem (breaks back-compatibility, too small for common use cases), and suggests raising it to a much larger number (e.g. 100, 1 000, 10 000) or removing it. While the exact new default value isn\u2019t rigidly fixed, it\u2019s straightforward to choose a reasonable bump (say 1 000) or make it effectively unlimited. There\u2019s enough context to implement a meaningful PR."
