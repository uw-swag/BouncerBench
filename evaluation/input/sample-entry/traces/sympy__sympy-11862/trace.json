  "trace": "The report includes a minimal reproducible example, clearly states the unexpected behavior (high-precision Floats being down-cast to double when lambdified with mpmath), shows actual vs. expected results, and identifies the module/context where the bug occurs. A developer can locate the lambdify printer for mpmath and ensure Floats are rendered as mpmath.mpf calls with full precision strings. This is sufficient to begin a targeted fix."
