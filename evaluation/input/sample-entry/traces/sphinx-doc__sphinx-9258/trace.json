  "trace": "The issue clearly requests adding support for parsing multiple types separated by a vertical bar in docstring type fields (e.g. \u201cbytes | str\u201d). While it doesn\u2019t spell out every parsing edge case or where in the codebase to hook in, the intent is unambiguous and there\u2019s a straightforward implementation path (split on \u2018|\u2019, trim, handle each type). Thus it\u2019s reasonably specified for an engineer familiar with the docstring parser to proceed."
