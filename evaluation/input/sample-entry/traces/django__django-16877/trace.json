  "trace": "The request clearly defines a new template filter 'escapeseq', its intended behavior (escape each item in a sequence when autoescape is off), and even gives a usage example. While implementation details (edge-cases, error handling, test cases) aren\u2019t spelled out, it\u2019s straightforward to derive them by analogy to the existing safeseq filter and Django\u2019s escape/conditional_escape utilities. Thus the spec is not completely exhaustive but gives enough to proceed."
