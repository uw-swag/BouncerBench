  "trace": "The request clearly defines the desired new API (renaming core.evaluate to core.parameters, introducing a dict-like global_parameters with __getitem__, attribute access, assignment, and a context\u2010manager interface) but leaves some implementation details open (integration with the existing module, thread\u2010safety, nested contexts, etc.). It\u2019s not fully fleshed out in every detail, but it\u2019s concrete enough to start coding a workable solution and iterate from there. Thus it\u2019s reasonably specified."
