  "trace": "The report clearly describes the scenario: with settings.LANGUAGES containing both \u201czh-hans\u201d and \u201czh-hant\u201d, a request header of \u201czh-Hant-HK\u201d is incorrectly matched to the first entry (\u201czh-hans\u201d) rather than to \u201czh-hant\u201d. It even points to the offending function (get_supported_language_variant), so there\u2019s enough context to write failing and passing tests and implement a fix. While some details (e.g. Django version) could help, you can reasonably reproduce and correct this behavior based on the description."
