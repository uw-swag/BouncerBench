  "trace": "The request is to enhance the Django Hypercorn ASGI docs with guidance on serving static files\u2014specifically by recommending and demonstrating the use of WhiteNoise.

Thus, it\u2019s reasonably specified: a developer can sensibly interpret what\u2019s needed and draft an appropriate docs patch."
