  "trace": "The report clearly describes the bug in the admin.E002 check, pinpoints the function to change (_check_raw_id_fields_item), explains that get_field will match on attname, and even gives the expected new guard (field.name == field_name) and the correct error call. All needed context is present or easily inferred from Django\u2019s admin checks, so it\u2019s well-specified."
