  "trace": "The report includes a minimal, self-contained code example showing the Sympy parse_expr behavior (with and without a local_dict), the exact mismatch between actual and expected results, and the expected outcome. It\u2019s immediately reproducible and clearly states what needs to change, so it\u2019s well specified for implementation."
