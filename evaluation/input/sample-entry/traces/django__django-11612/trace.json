  "trace": "The report clearly describes the bug (double\u2010quoting of user\u2010provided quoted db_table names in SQLite3 migrations), shows the exact broken SQL, a minimal reproduction (a quoted db_table with a ForeignKey), and where in the code the bad SQL is generated (sqlite3/schema.py). The desired outcome\u2014support for quoted names without syntax errors\u2014is also obvious. It\u2019s straightforward to write a fix that strips existing quotes or otherwise normalizes the table name before quoting."
