  "trace": "The report clearly identifies a reproducible bug (PicklingError on django.db.models.query.Row instances returned by values_list(named=True)), shows example code and error, and states the desired outcome (Row should be pickleable so things like cacheops will work).

This is a well\u2010scoped, self\u2010contained fix."
