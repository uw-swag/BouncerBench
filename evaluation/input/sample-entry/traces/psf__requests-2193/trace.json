  "trace": "The issue simply shows that urllib3.exceptions.ProtocolError is bubbling up instead of being wrapped by Requests, but it doesn\u2019t describe the expected behavior in detail, when it regressed, or which wrapper exception should be used. There\u2019s no reproduction steps beyond a trivial snippet, no context about the change, and no test case. It\u2019s unclear what the precise fix should be or how to verify it, so it\u2019s too vague to act on."
