  "trace": "The report clearly states that the dot\u2010printer is emitting the arguments of Pow in the wrong order (showing 2\u2192x instead of x\u21922), and that both the code and the tutorial snippet need to be updated. There\u2019s no ambiguity about what correct output looks like (a Pow node with left child x and right child 2), and a developer familiar with the dot printer can implement and verify the change directly. Therefore it\u2019s WELL_SPECIFIED."
