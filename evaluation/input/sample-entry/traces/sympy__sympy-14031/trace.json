  "trace": "The report supplies a minimal reproducer (the code snippet and exact error), references related issue #13970 for context, and clearly states that integration should succeed where it currently fails. While it doesn\u2019t spell out the precise fix or the expected antiderivative, there\u2019s enough information to reproduce the bug and infer that the coercion logic for expressions involving exp(1/2) must be extended. Hence it\u2019s reasonably specified."
