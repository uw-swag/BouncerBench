  "trace": "The feature request clearly outlines three distinct utilities (calendar accessor, calendar conversion function, calendar-aware date_range), gives suggested APIs, describes behavior (e.g. dropping invalid dates), and even points to existing implementations for reference. While some implementation details (error handling, argument validation, integration points) remain to be filled in, there is a sensible design and clear success criteria. This makes it reasonably specified for a meaningful implementation."
