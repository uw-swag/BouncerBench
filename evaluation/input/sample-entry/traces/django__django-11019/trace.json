  "trace": "The report gives a concrete minimal example (3 widgets with specific JS dependencies), shows the current wrong result and warning, and states the desired behavior (correct ordering without spurious warnings). It clearly identifies where in the code (widgets.py) the merge logic and warning are happening. That makes it actionable: implement a proper topological merge of multiple Media objects and emit warnings only on true cycle/contradiction. Therefore it\u2019s well-specified."
