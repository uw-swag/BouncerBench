  "trace": "The bug report clearly describes how to reproduce the error, shows the traceback, and pinpoints that DecimalField skips validation for \u201cnan\u201d and crashes on retrieval. However, it doesn\u2019t spell out the desired behavior (e.g. whether to reject NaN on save or to special-case it on fetch), so you\u2019d need to make an implementation choice. It\u2019s not so vague that you can\u2019t act on it, but it isn\u2019t completely closed either."
