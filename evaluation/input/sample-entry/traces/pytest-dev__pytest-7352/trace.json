  "trace": "The report clearly shows where the error occurs (in pytest\u2019s tmpdir numbered-dir cleanup, specifically in pathlib.py) and suggests a concrete mitigation (use a random suffix rather than sequential numbering, or at least guard against missing .lock files).

This makes it REASONABLY_SPECIFIED rather than fully \u201cwell-specified.\u201d"
