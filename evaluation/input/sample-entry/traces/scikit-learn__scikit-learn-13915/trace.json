  "trace": "The issue provides a clear description of the bug, exact steps and code to reproduce it, the expected versus actual behavior, and the relevant environment (32-bit Windows with int64 indptr). It\u2019s straightforward to identify where in sparsefuncs.min_max_axis one needs to handle/convert the indptr dtype to the platform\u2019s pointer size (intp) so the ufunc.reduceat call won\u2019t error. A developer can write a PR to cast or enforce the correct index dtype based on this information."
