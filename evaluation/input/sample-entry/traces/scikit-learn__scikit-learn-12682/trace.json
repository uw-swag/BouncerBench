  "trace": "The issue clearly identifies that SparseCoder\u2019s use of Lasso doesn\u2019t allow adjusting max_iter, leading to convergence warnings. It suggests exposing additional estimator parameters (like max_iter) via the SparseCoder API. While the exact signature isn\u2019t spelled out (e.g. whether to add max_iter directly or accept a dict of lasso_params), it\u2019s obvious what needs to be done and how to test it. This makes the ticket reasonably specified for implementation."
