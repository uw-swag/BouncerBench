  "trace": "The request mixes two concerns (deduplicating arguments in Intersection and changing evaluation to a Piecewise or leaving unevaluated) without a clear specification of which behaviour is required (or under what conditions). There are no details on how to detect duplicates in practice, where in the code to apply it, or whether to implement the piecewise logic or simply block evaluation. The success criteria are left ambiguous, so it\u2019s not well-specified."
