  "trace": "The report clearly identifies a specific bug (floatformat always using USE_L10N, ignoring {% localize %} blocks), points to the exact code lines, and states the desired behavior (read use_l10n from the template context or allow forcing an unlocalized format). While it doesn\u2019t spell out every implementation step (e.g. using @contextfilter), a Django maintainer can fill in those details. This makes the issue actionable without further clarification."
