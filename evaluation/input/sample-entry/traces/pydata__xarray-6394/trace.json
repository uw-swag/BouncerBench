  "trace": "The report includes a minimal reproducer, clear error logs, and references to related PRs/issues (#5692, #6379, #6386) so a maintainer can track the intended behavior and fix it. It doesn\u2019t explicitly spell out the exact expected output values, but the context and examples make the goal clear. Hence it is reasonably specified."
