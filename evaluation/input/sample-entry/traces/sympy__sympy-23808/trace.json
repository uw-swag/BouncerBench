  "trace": "The report gives a clear, minimal reproducible example (calling sum_of_squares on n and k), shows the exact recursion error and context, and points out that small inputs (like 10\u2076) should work. While it doesn\u2019t prescribe a specific fix or API change, it is straightforward to understand the bug (unbounded recursion) and what a correct solution should achieve (produce the sum-of-squares decomposition without overflow)."
