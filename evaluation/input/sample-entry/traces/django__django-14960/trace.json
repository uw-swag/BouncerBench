  "trace": "The issue clearly describes the bug (field.clean is skipped for REQUIRED_FIELDS passed via --flags in interactive mode), points to the relevant code paths (non-interactive validation, get_input_data in interactive), and states the desired outcome (validate the passed values). While it doesn\u2019t include exact code snippets or tests, it provides enough context to reproduce and implement the fix (run validation on CLI-passed values just like interactive inputs)."
