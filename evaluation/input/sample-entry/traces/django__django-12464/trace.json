  "trace": "The report clearly identifies exactly where in the SQLite backend (lines 60\u201364 of django/db/backends/sqlite3/operations.py) a `NotSupportedError` is being raised for `DISTINCT` on aggregates that SQLite actually does allow (e.g. `GROUP_CONCAT(expr)`). It even provides a minimal custom `GroupConcat` implementation to reproduce it and points to the underlying SQLite documentation. While you\u2019ll still need to decide precisely how to adjust or remove that check (and add a test), there\u2019s no ambiguity about what change is needed: alter or remove the `NotSupportedError` guard so that one\u2010expression aggregates marked `allow_distinct=True` can emit `DISTINCT` in SQLite. That makes it reasonably specified for a developer to write the patch and tests."
