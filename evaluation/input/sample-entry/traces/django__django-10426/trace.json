It\u2019s obvious what needs to be done: replicate the existing validation logic in showmigrations (likely by calling the same validation helper). A Django contributor can locate the command\u2019s code, see how other commands validate the app_label, and insert the same checks here. This is sufficiently and precisely specified."
