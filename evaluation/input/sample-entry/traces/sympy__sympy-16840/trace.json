  "trace": "The report clearly identifies a mismatch: using SymPy\u2019s floor\u2010division (`//`) on `S(2)` by `S.Half` currently raises a ZeroDivisionError, even though in pure Python `2//0.5` yields `4`. The expected remedy\u2014implementing floor\u2010division for SymPy rationals to return the correct result\u2014is obvious. Some details (exact return type, code location) aren\u2019t spelled out, but there\u2019s a straightforward, sensible interpretation of what needs to change."
