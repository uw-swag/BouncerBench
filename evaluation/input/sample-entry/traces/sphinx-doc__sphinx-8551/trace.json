  "trace": "The issue clearly describes a mismatched lookup behavior between implicit xrefs in :type:/:rtype: fields vs explicit roles, provides minimal reproducible RST, shows the exact warnings emitted, and states the expected behavior (use current-module-first resolution to avoid ambiguity). There\u2019s enough context and examples to write a reproducible test and patch the lookup logic in the Python domain. Hence it\u2019s well-specified."
