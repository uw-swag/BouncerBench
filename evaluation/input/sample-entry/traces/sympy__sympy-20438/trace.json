  "trace": "The report shows that for two identical sets b (a ProductSet) and c (a FiniteSet of pairs), b.is_subset(c) returns None while c.is_subset(b) returns True, and also that calling simplify on Eq(b, c) raises an AttributeError. However, it doesn\u2019t clearly define which of these issues should be fixed (is_subset, simplify logic, rewrite behavior), what the expected API is, or how broadly the fix should apply. The scope of the intended change is unclear, so a meaningful PR can\u2019t be scoped precisely without clarification."
