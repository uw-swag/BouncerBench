  "trace": "The report clearly identifies a specific buggy behavior (trigsimp treating sqrt(sin(x)**2) as sin(x) for general complex x) and notes the correct behavior when x is real. While it doesn\u2019t spell out the exact desired output in all cases (e.g. whether to leave sqrt(sin(x)**2) intact or convert to Abs), there\u2019s a straightforward interpretation: restrict that simplification to real\u2010valued x or introduce an Abs term. This is enough to begin designing a fix."
