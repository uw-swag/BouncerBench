  "trace": "The issue reads more like a discussion question than a concrete request. It doesn\u2019t point to the exact code location, specify the desired new behavior or acceptance criteria, or outline how shape validation should change. Without those details, it\u2019s unclear what a successful implementation would look like, so the issue is too vague to act on directly."
