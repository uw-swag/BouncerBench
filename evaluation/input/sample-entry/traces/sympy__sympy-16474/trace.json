While the exact symbols or formatting details (e.g. the \u201cdivision symbol\u201d for HadamardProduct) aren\u2019t spelled out, a developer familiar with the codebase can infer where to add or extend `_print_*` methods in the respective printer modules. There\u2019s a straightforward interpretation of what needs to be done, so it\u2019s reasonably specified."
