  "trace": "The issue clearly states the input expressions and the desired output (e.g. simplifying (\u2212I*exp(I*k)+I*exp(\u2212I*k))/2 to sin(k) and similarly to sinc(k)). While it\u2019s a feature request rather than a bug report, the examples give a concrete specification of expected behavior. There\u2019s enough information to attempt a solution (e.g. enhancing trigsimp or adding a new simplifier), so it\u2019s reasonably specified."
