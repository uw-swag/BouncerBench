  "trace": "The issue clearly reproduces a specific error (TypeError due to treating an itertools.chain as subscriptable) and points to the exact code location. Even though it doesn\u2019t include a full patch or desired code snippet, it\u2019s straightforward to infer that the fix is to materialize the chain into a list (or otherwise avoid indexing the chain directly). The requirements for a fix are therefore clear enough to implement."
