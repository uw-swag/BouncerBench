  "trace": "The issue report provides a traceback and environment details but lacks any pinpointed cause or minimal reproduction steps beyond a generic Sphinx build. It doesn\u2019t identify which document, directive, or pattern is triggering the IndexError, so it\u2019s unclear what needs to be fixed. A meaningful solution would require more specifics (e.g., the problematic source file or code snippet)."
