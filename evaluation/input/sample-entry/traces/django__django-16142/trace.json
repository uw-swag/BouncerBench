  "trace": "The request clearly states what behavior should change (get_language_from_request should return None instead of falling back to settings.LANGUAGE_CODE) and why. While it doesn\u2019t include every code detail (e.g., exact function location or test adjustments), it gives enough guidance to implement and verify the change in a typical Django codebase. Hence it is reasonably specified."
