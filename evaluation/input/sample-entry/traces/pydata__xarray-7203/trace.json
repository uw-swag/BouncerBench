  "trace": "The issue clearly describes the performance problem (repr loading data for each variable), provides a minimal reproducible example, points to the exact lines in formatting.py to change, and states the expected behavior (fast repr without data loads). This is sufficient to implement a concrete fix (e.g. use .shape instead of .size or otherwise avoid triggering data loads in repr)."
