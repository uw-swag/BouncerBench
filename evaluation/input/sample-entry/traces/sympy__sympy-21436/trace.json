  "trace": "The report clearly defines the unwanted behavior (orient() always clears all existing frame links), gives concrete examples of current vs. desired behavior (including the reversal and loop\u2010detection cases), and even points to the specific dcm_dict clearing. You can sensibly interpret the fix as: stop the blanket clear, only remove existing direct neighbors when explicitly re\u2010orienting a pair, and raise on any indirect \u201cloop\u201d link, leaving all other links intact. While the precise graph\u2010update algorithm will need to be designed and may require iterating on edge cases, there is a clear, coherent target and examples. This is \u2018reasonably specified\u2019 \u2014 you know what to change and what tests to add, even if you\u2019ll need to flesh out some details of the adjacency\u2010update logic."
