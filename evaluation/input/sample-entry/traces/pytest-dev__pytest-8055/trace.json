  "trace": "The issue merely points out that Python 3.8 introduced sys.unraisablehook and suggests that pytest \u201cshould set\u201d it so unraisable exceptions can be tied back to the right test. It doesn\u2019t spell out the hook\u2019s contract, the lifecycle (when to install and uninstall), how and where to store or report the exceptions, nor provide any concrete examples or acceptance criteria. There\u2019s a clear direction, but too many details are left undefined, making it ambiguous what a correct implementation would look like without further clarification."
