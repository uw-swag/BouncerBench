  "trace": "The report provides a high-level description of a proxy authentication failure under Python 3.8.12 but omits the actual proxy configuration (credentials, proxy URL), error details (tracebacks, headers), and a reproducible test case. Without knowing exactly how the `proxies` dict is set up or seeing the request/response exchange, one cannot reliably reproduce or diagnose the 407 error. As a result, the issue is too vague to attempt a meaningful fix."
