  "trace": "The report provides a minimal, self\u2010contained reproduction (project layout, pytest config, exact error), clearly describes the regression (pytest 7.0.0 importlib + pythonpath issue when conftest.py is present) and the expected behavior (imports should work as in earlier versions). This is enough information for a developer to write a failing test and implement a fix."
