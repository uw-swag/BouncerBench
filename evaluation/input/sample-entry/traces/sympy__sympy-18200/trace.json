  "trace": "The report clearly demonstrates a failing call, shows the traceback pinpointing the `int` vs. `.free_symbols` misuse in `intersection_sets`, and ties into the diophantine\u2010intersection handler. Although it doesn\u2019t spell out the precise \u201cshould return\u201d value, it\u2019s obvious that the intersection of all squares with the integers shouldn\u2019t crash, so a fix guarding against int results and falling back to a correct ImageSet is straightforward. Hence the issue is reasonably specified."
