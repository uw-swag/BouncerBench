  "trace": "The ticket clearly identifies that Figure.add_axes currently accepts more than one positional argument (e.g. \u201cFalse, 1\u201d) without any documented behavior. It proposes either documenting their effect (if any) or deprecating extra positional parameters. The goal\u2014restrict add_axes to only one positional argument and push all others to keywords\u2014is clear enough to start coding. Some details (exact deprecation timing/mechanism) can be filled in via standard project conventions, but the core requirement is well understood."
