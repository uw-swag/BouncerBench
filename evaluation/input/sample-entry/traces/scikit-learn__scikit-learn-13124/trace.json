  "trace": "The issue clearly describes a mismatch between the documented behavior of StratifiedKFold.shuffle (which says \u201cshuffle each stratification of the data before splitting into batches\u201d) and the actual implementation (which only shuffles the order of the resulting folds, not the samples within each stratum). The reporter provides minimal reproducible code, expected vs. actual output, and a precise statement of what needs to change (i.e., samples within each class should be shuffled before fold assignment). There is no ambiguity about reproducing or fixing the bug, so the issue is well-specified."
