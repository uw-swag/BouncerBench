  "trace": "The issue simply dumps a set of failing tests under NumPy 1.23.0rc3 without describing the intended behavior, root cause analysis, or specific change required. There is no clear description of what to fix in the code (e.g., how _compare should handle mixed dtype comparisons or which tests should be updated). As provided, it\u2019s ambiguous where in the code to apply a patch or what the correct comparison semantics should be. Hence it\u2019s too vague to implement a meaningful solution."
