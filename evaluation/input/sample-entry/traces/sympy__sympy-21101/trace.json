  "trace": "The report notes that `latex(Mul(6, S.Half, evaluate=False))` emits \u201c6 1/2\u201d without the usual number-separating space, but it never states what the correct LaTeX string should look like or how much spacing is expected. It assumes familiarity with internal printer settings (\u201cnumbersep\u201d) but gives no example of the desired output. Without an explicit \u201cexpected vs. actual\u201d or a precise spec for the spacing, it\u2019s unclear what code change will satisfy the report. Thus it\u2019s too vague to implement directly."
