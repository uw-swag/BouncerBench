  "trace": "The report clearly describes the incorrect string\u2010based version comparison in needs_extensions, shows how to reproduce it, and states the expected behavior (numeric version comparison so 0.10 \u2265 0.6). Fixing it is unambiguous: update needs_extensions to parse and compare versions numerically (e.g. via packaging.version)."
