  "trace": "The issue clearly describes the environment (Django 2.1 \u2192 2.2b1), the custom subclassed middleware, the exact error code (admin.E408), and the observed behavior change. It\u2019s obvious that the admin middleware check is too strict and should allow subclasses of AuthenticationMiddleware.
