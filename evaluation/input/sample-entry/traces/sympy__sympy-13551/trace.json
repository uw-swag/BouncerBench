  "trace": "The report shows a specific Sympy failure for Product(n + 2^{\u2212k}, [k,0,n\u22121]) and notes it should involve a q-Pochhammer closed form, but it doesn\u2019t give the actual target formula or sufficient detail on how to implement or represent it. Without the explicit desired expression or guidelines on how to integrate it into Sympy\u2019s product routines, it\u2019s unclear how to produce or verify a correct solution."
