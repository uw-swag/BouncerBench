  "trace": "The report clearly demonstrates a bug (an AttributeError when SimpleImputer tries to access .dtype on a DataFrame) and shows where in the code it happens. While it doesn\u2019t spell out exactly how the API should behave on DataFrame inputs (e.g. whether to reject non-numeric columns outright or to coerce to numpy before checking), there is a straightforward, sensible fix: detect pandas DataFrames, pull out their dtypes correctly (using .dtypes or converting to numpy), and then raise the existing ValueError for non-numeric data as intended. The scope is narrow, the location in code is pointed out, and the expected behavior (properly rejecting object columns with a ValueError rather than crashing) is clear enough to implement a solution."
