  "trace": "The issue clearly states the current vs. expected behavior with minimal code examples. It specifies that after calling cla() or clf(), deparented artists should have their .axes and .figure attributes unset (i.e. set to None), just as artist.remove() does. The scope is well-bounded (modifying Axes.cla and Figure.clf), and there is no ambiguity about what needs to be done. Thus the issue is well-specified."
