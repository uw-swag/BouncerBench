  "trace": "The report clearly describes the bug with concrete code snippets, shows actual vs. expected output, and isolates the condition (ignoring \u201cx\u201d works incorrectly but ignoring \u201cy\u201d works). It\u2019s reproducible, version-tagged, and specifies the desired behavior, so a contributor can jump straight into a fix."
