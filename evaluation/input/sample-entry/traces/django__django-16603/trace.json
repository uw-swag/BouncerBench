  "trace": "The issue clearly describes the bug, pinpoints the exact code location, and even supplies a failing test and the desired behavior (no response should be sent after a disconnect mid-request).

It\u2019s not perfectly spelled out step-by-step, but it\u2019s concrete enough to begin a PR."
