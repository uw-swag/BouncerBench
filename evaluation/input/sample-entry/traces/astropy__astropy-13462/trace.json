  "trace": "The issue clearly shows a failing test, the exact lines of code involved, reproducible input values, and the expected symmetric behavior of the two_sum function. A developer with full access to the codebase can locate the two_sum implementation and adjust its algorithm to ensure the error term is computed consistently regardless of argument order. No further clarification is needed to attempt a fix."
