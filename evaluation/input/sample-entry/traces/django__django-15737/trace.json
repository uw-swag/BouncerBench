  "trace": "The ticket clearly describes the bug, its root cause in Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save(), and even suggests the exact line change (replace setattr(self, field.attname, obj.pk) with setattr(self, field.name, obj)). With model/file location known, reproducer code, and the intended patch, it\u2019s well-specified for implementation."
