  "trace": "The report includes a minimal reproducible example, describes the change in behavior (pytest 6.2.0 now exposing the generated unittest setUpClass fixture without a leading underscore), and clearly states the expected behavior (the fixture name should start with an underscore so it remains private unless -v is used).
