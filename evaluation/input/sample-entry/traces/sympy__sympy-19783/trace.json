  "trace": "The report clearly shows the undesired behavior (Dagger(A) * IdentityOperator remains unsimplified) and the expected result (it should simplify to Dagger(A), just as A * Identity simplifies to A). While it doesn\u2019t provide implementation details or tests, the goal is straightforward and there is a clear interpretation of the fix needed (add a simplification rule for Dagger \u00d7 IdentityOperator)."
