  "trace": "The issue is more of a discussion/meta-question about testing and a one-line change rather than a concrete, self-contained bug specification. It doesn\u2019t clearly define the expected behavior, replication steps, or a testable outcome, nor does it specify exactly where or how to implement the change. There\u2019s room for interpretation on what constitutes a successful solution and how to validate it, so it\u2019s too ambiguous to act on without further clarification."
