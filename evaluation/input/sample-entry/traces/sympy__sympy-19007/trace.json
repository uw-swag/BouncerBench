  "trace": "The report clearly shows the bug: BlockMatrix.__getitem__ eagerly simplifies C[i,0] to A[i,0], but when i is symbolic it could refer to A (for i=0) or B (for i>0). It gives a minimal example, current vs. intended behavior (\u201cshould not be simplified\u201d), and enough context to know where to change the code (in __getitem__). There\u2019s some detail left on the exact form of the unevaluated return, but it\u2019s straightforward to choose to return a BlockMatrixElement or defer evaluation. Hence it\u2019s reasonably specified."
