  "trace": "The report shows a specific OverflowError in Django when a URL contains an integer too large for SQLite, but it never states what the desired behavior should be (e.g. catch the error and return a 404, validate the PK before querying, or otherwise handle large integers). There\u2019s no clear acceptance criterion or spec for how Django should behave, so it\u2019s ambiguous what a successful fix looks like."
