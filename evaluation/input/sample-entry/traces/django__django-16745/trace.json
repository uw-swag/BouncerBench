  "trace": "The report clearly describes the discrepancy between HTML5 number inputs (which use the min value as the base for step calculations) and Django\u2019s StepValueValidator (which always uses 0). It gives concrete examples (HTML snippet vs. IntegerField setup), points to the exact validator, and describes the desired alignment with browser behavior. A developer can jump in and update StepValueValidator to use min_value as the origin for step checks, so the issue is well specified."
