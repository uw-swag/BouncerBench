  "trace": "The report clearly describes the problem (TypeError when using GeoAxes in AxesGrid), provides minimal reproducible code, the exact traceback, and the environment. While the \u201cExpected outcome\u201d text is blank, it\u2019s implicit that AxesGrid should accept a custom axis_class (GeoAxes) without error and render as normal. The root cause is localized (_tick_only indexing ax.axis) and the fix direction is obvious. Thus the issue is well-specified."
