  "trace": "The report clearly identifies the file (`w0wzcdm.py`), the exact line (205), and the intended correction (flip the sign in the exponent). While it lacks a runnable example or tests, there\u2019s a straightforward change to implement and verify (update `exp(-3.0 * self._wz * z)` to `exp(3.0 * self._wz * z)`). Thus it\u2019s interpretable and actionable without further clarification."
