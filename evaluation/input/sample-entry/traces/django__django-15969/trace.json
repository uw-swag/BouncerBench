It reads more like a support question about why SET_NULL is implemented this way rather than a clearly specified bug or feature request with acceptance criteria. The lack of a defined resolution path makes it ambiguous whether a code change or documentation tweak would satisfy the issue, so it\u2019s too vague to frame a PR around."
