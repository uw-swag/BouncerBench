  "trace": "The request clearly states the needed behavior: in the migration optimizer, just as CreateModel+AlterModelOptions are merged into a single CreateModel, CreateModel+AlterModelManagers should also be collapsed to CreateModel.

The goal and scope are unambiguous, so this is reasonably specified."
