  "trace": "The issue clearly shows how to reproduce the error (summing a vector and zero via Python\u2019s built-in sum) and indicates that the sum should probably return a Vector rather than raising a TypeError. While the desired behavior (allowing 0 in vector addition/sum) can be sensibly inferred and there\u2019s a known one-line fix in Vector.__add__ or by adding __radd__, the report doesn\u2019t explicitly state the expected result or exact fix. Thus it\u2019s not perfectly detailed, but there\u2019s enough here for a straightforward implementation."
