  "trace": "The issue pinpoints a misalignment in the pretty\u2010printed Sum output and notes that the \u2018x\u2019 and \u2018+3\u2019 should be aligned, but it doesn\u2019t specify which element should move (whether to lower the \u2018x\u2019 or raise the \u2018+3\u2019) nor provide a concrete desired output example. Without a clear target layout or decision on the baseline, implementers would lack the necessary detail to know what a correct solution looks like."
