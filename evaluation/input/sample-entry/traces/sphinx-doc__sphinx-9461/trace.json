  "trace": "The report clearly describes the bug, gives a minimal repro project with exact steps to reproduce, lists the missing symbols, specifies the environment (OS, Python, Sphinx, extensions) and states the desired behavior. There\u2019s no ambiguity about what\u2019s broken or what fixing it should achieve, so it\u2019s well\u2010specified for someone with access to the codebase to implement a solution."
