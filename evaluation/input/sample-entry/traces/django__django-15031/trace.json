  "trace": "The issue clearly identifies a problem (the inability to include commas in \u2018__in\u2019 lookup values) and even points to the relevant function (prepare_lookup_value). However, it doesn\u2019t specify how escaped commas should be handled, what syntax or escaping convention to use, or any desired behavior or backward\u2010compatibility guarantees. Without details on the expected API or escaping rules, there\u2019s too much ambiguity to implement a meaningful solution."
