  "trace": "The report includes a minimal reproducible example, the full traceback, and clearly identifies the failure point in the scale setup when a boolean array is passed to a continuous scale. While it doesn\u2019t spell out exactly how to map booleans (e.g. use a categorical palette), there is a sensible interpretation\u2014treat boolean inputs as categorical variables and dispatch to a categorical color scale\u2014so you can implement a fix without further clarifications."
