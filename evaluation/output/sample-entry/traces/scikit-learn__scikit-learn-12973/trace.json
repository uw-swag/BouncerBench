Because it's a simple bug, it's much easier to see in the code directly than in the execution, so I am not posting steps to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nAs you can see here, LassoLarsIC accepts a copy_X parameter.\r\nhttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7389dbac82d362f296dc2746f10e43ffa1615660/sklearn/linear_model/least_angle.py#L1487\r\n\r\nHowever, it also takes a copy_X parameter a few lines below, in the definition of ```fit```.\r\n    ```def fit(self, X, y, copy_X=True):```\r\n\r\nNow there are two values (potentially contradicting each other) for copy_X and each one is used once. Therefore ```fit``` can have a mixed behaviour. Even worse, this can be completely invisible to the user, since copy_X has a default value of True. Let's assume that I'd like it to be False, and have set it to False in the initialization, `my_lasso = LassoLarsIC(copy_X=False)`. I then call ```my_lasso.fit(X, y)``` and my choice will be silently overwritten. \r\n\r\nIdeally I think that copy_X should be removed as an argument in ```fit```. No other estimator seems to have a duplication in class parameters and fit arguments (I've checked more than ten in the linear models module). However, this would break existing code. Therefore I propose that ```fit``` takes a default value of `None` and only overwrites the existing value if the user has explicitly passed it as an argument to ```fit```. I will submit a PR to that effect.\n\n</ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\n\nPlease first provide a concise reasoning for your classification, and then clearly state your classification in the format: <EXPLANATION>reasoning</EXPLANATION><LABEL>label</LABEL>."
