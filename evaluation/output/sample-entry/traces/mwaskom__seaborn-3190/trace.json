        "text": "<EXPLANATION>The patch forces both vmin and vmax through int() before applying forward, which fixes boolean data (True/False \u2192 1/0) but also silently truncates any continuous floating inputs (e.g. 0.5 \u2192 0), corrupting real-valued scales. It also applies this to all ContinuousBase scales without checking for boolean dtype. A correct fix would only coerce booleans to numeric (or cast forward\u2019s result to float) when needed, not indiscriminately cast all domain values to int. Therefore the patch is over-broad and misses key aspects.</EXPLANATION><LABEL>BROAD_MISSING_KEY_ASPECTS</LABEL>",
