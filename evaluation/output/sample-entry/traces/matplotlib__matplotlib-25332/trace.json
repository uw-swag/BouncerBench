By popping `_align_label_groups` out of the state in `__getstate__`, the patch prevents these unpicklable weakrefs from ever being serialized. This change is minimal, focused exactly on the symptom, and doesn\u2019t introduce unrelated changes or miss any other aspect described in the issue. Therefore it correctly and precisely addresses the issue.</EXPLANATION><LABEL>CORRECT_AND_PRECISE</LABEL>",
