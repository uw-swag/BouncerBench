The patch changes it to use __spec__.name (the full module name) first, falling back to parent only if name is missing. That exactly restores the full dotted name (foo.bar.baz) in the child args without touching anything else. No extraneous changes were made. </EXPLANATION><LABEL>CORRECT_AND_PRECISE</LABEL>",
