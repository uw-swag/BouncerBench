However, it removes the `from __future__ import annotations` boilerplate and never imports `Expr`, so referencing `Expr` will raise a NameError. This indicates the patch is fundamentally flawed and would break the module rather than correctly address the issue.</EXPLANATION><LABEL>INCORRECT</LABEL>",
