IMHO it should fall back to the ordering defined in the related model's Meta.ordering field.\nRelatedOnlyFieldListFilter doesn't order the related model at all, even if ordering is defined on the related model's ModelAdmin class.\nThat's because the call to field.get_choices \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/2.2.1/django/contrib/admin/filters.py#L422 omits the ordering kwarg entirely.\n\n</ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\n\nPlease first provide a concise reasoning for your classification, and then clearly state your classification in the format: <EXPLANATION>reasoning</EXPLANATION><LABEL>label</LABEL>."
