You have the full issue description, the original codebase before the fix, and the proposed patch. \n\nYou have full access to the codebase which you can browse freely as required. Do not attempt to make any changes to the codebase or execute any code.\n\nYou cannot test the patch directly; you must evaluate solely based on the supplied information and by reviewing the codebase.\n\nYour objective is to determine if the patch correctly addresses the issue described.\n\nPlease explain your reasoning and choose one of the following labels based on your evaluation:\n\nCORRECT_AND_PRECISE: The patch addresses the described issue without unnecessary changes.\n\nCORRECT_BUT_INCOMPLETE: The patch addresses the described issue but may fail to catch certain edge cases.\n\nBROAD_MISSING_KEY_ASPECTS: The patch misses some key aspects described in the issue or makes additional unrelated changes that are irrelevant to the issue.\n\nINCORRECT: The patch fails to address the issue or fundamentally misunderstands the requirements.\n\nPatches labeled BROAD_MISSING_KEY_ASPECTS or INCORRECT are considered insufficient and will be discarded.\n\n<PATCH>\ndiff --git a/sympy/algebras/quaternion.py b/sympy/algebras/quaternion.py\nindex b84e7cb..7eae8d7 100644\n--- a/sympy/algebras/quaternion.py\n+++ b/sympy/algebras/quaternion.py\n@@ -529,7 +529,7 @@ class Quaternion(Expr):\n \n         m10 = 2*s*(q.b*q.c + q.d*q.a)\n         m11 = 1 - 2*s*(q.b**2 + q.d**2)\n-        m12 = 2*s*(q.c*q.d + q.b*q.a)\n+        m12 = 2*s*(q.c*q.d - q.b*q.a)\n \n         m20 = 2*s*(q.b*q.d - q.c*q.a)\n         m21 = 2*s*(q.c*q.d + q.b*q.a)\n\n</PATCH>\n\nDoes this patch correctly address the issue described below?\n\n<ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\nIncorrect result with Quaterniont.to_rotation_matrix()\nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/ab14b02dba5a7e3e4fb1e807fc8a954f1047a1a1/sympy/algebras/quaternion.py#L489\r\n\r\nThere appears to be an error in the `Quaternion.to_rotation_matrix()` output.  The simplest example I created to illustrate the problem is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>import sympy\r\n>>print('Sympy version: ', sympy.__version__)\r\nSympy version: 1.2\r\n\r\n>> from sympy import *\r\n>> x = symbols('x')\r\n>> q = Quaternion(cos(x/2), sin(x/2), 0, 0)\r\n>> trigsimp(q.to_rotation_matrix())\r\nMatrix([\r\n[1,      0,      0],\r\n[0, cos(x), sin(x)],\r\n[0, sin(x), cos(x)]])\r\n```\r\nOne of the `sin(x)` functions should be negative.  What was the reference of the original equations?  \n\n</ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\n\nPlease first provide a concise reasoning for your classification, and then clearly state your classification in the format: <EXPLANATION>reasoning</EXPLANATION><LABEL>label</LABEL>."
