You have the full issue description, the original codebase before the fix, and the proposed patch. \n\nYou have full access to the codebase which you can browse freely as required. Do not attempt to make any changes to the codebase or execute any code.\n\nYou cannot test the patch directly; you must evaluate solely based on the supplied information and by reviewing the codebase.\n\nYour objective is to determine if the patch correctly addresses the issue described.\n\nPlease explain your reasoning and choose one of the following labels based on your evaluation:\n\nCORRECT_AND_PRECISE: The patch addresses the described issue without unnecessary changes.\n\nCORRECT_BUT_INCOMPLETE: The patch addresses the described issue but may fail to catch certain edge cases.\n\nBROAD_MISSING_KEY_ASPECTS: The patch misses some key aspects described in the issue or makes additional unrelated changes that are irrelevant to the issue.\n\nINCORRECT: The patch fails to address the issue or fundamentally misunderstands the requirements.\n\nPatches labeled BROAD_MISSING_KEY_ASPECTS or INCORRECT are considered insufficient and will be discarded.\n\n<PATCH>\ndiff --git a/django/contrib/admin/helpers.py b/django/contrib/admin/helpers.py\nindex dd154f7..ba8c346 100644\n--- a/django/contrib/admin/helpers.py\n+++ b/django/contrib/admin/helpers.py\n@@ -209,7 +209,11 @@ class AdminReadonlyField:\n             remote_field.model._meta.model_name,\n         )\n         try:\n-            url = reverse(url_name, args=[quote(remote_obj.pk)])\n+            url = reverse(\n+                url_name,\n+                args=[quote(remote_obj.pk)],\n+                current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name\n+            )\n             return format_html('<a href=\"{}\">{}</a>', url, remote_obj)\n         except NoReverseMatch:\n             return str(remote_obj)\n\n</PATCH>\n\nDoes this patch correctly address the issue described below?\n\n<ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\nWrong URL generated by get_admin_url for readonly field in custom Admin Site\nDescription\n\t\nWhen a model containing a ForeignKey field is viewed (or edited) in a custom Admin Site, and that ForeignKey field is listed in readonly_fields, the url generated for the link is /admin/... instead of /custom-admin/....\nThis appears to be caused by the following line in django.contrib.admin.helpers get_admin_url:\nurl = reverse(url_name, args=[quote(remote_obj.pk)])\nOther parts of the admin use the current_app keyword parameter to identify the correct current name of the Admin Site. (See django.contrib.admin.options.ModelAdmin response_add as just one example)\nI have been able to correct this specific issue by replacing the above line with:\nurl = reverse(\n\turl_name,\n\targs=[quote(remote_obj.pk)],\n\tcurrent_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name\n)\nHowever, I don't know if there are any side effects and I have not yet run the full suite of tests on this.
