In fact it does work on Python 3's unicode `str`s, but here it assumes that the data can be ASCII-encoded.\r\n\r\nIts counterpart, `Header.fromfile` will work with files opened in text or binary mode.  So probably the simplest solution for now (as opposed to adding new methods or something like that) is to change `Header.fromstring` to accept unicode or bytes string types.\r\n\r\n`Card.fromstring` likely needs a similar treatment.\n\n</ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\n\nPlease first provide a concise reasoning for your classification, and then clearly state your classification in the format: <EXPLANATION>reasoning</EXPLANATION><LABEL>label</LABEL>."
