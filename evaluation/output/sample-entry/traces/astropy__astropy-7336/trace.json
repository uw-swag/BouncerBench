Unfortunately, then a static type checker cannot infer that this function returns nothing.\r\n\r\n### Possible fix\r\nMaybe the decorator could explicitly check whether None is returned and then omit the unit check.\n\n</ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\n\nPlease first provide a concise reasoning for your classification, and then clearly state your classification in the format: <EXPLANATION>reasoning</EXPLANATION><LABEL>label</LABEL>."

It checks both that the return annotation is neither empty nor None and also that the returned value is not None before attempting a unit conversion. The new unit\u2010input logic is unchanged beyond this minimal fix, and a new test ensures the constructor case no longer raises. This directly addresses the reported issue without over\u2010 or under\u2010reaching. </EXPLANATION><LABEL>CORRECT_AND_PRECISE</LABEL>",
