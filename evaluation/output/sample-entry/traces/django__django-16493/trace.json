Moving the \u201ccallable\u201d check first ensures that if the user passed in a storage callable, that original callable is always captured in migrations\u2014regardless of what it returns. The fallback to the old \u201cinstance \u2260 default\u201d check for non\u2010callable storages is left untouched. This is a minimal, targeted change that exactly fixes the described bug without side effects.\n</EXPLANATION><LABEL>CORRECT_AND_PRECISE</LABEL>",
