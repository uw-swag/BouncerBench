You have the full issue description, the original codebase before the fix, and the proposed patch. \n\nYou have full access to the codebase which you can browse freely as required. Do not attempt to make any changes to the codebase or execute any code.\n\nYou cannot test the patch directly; you must evaluate solely based on the supplied information and by reviewing the codebase.\n\nYour objective is to determine if the patch correctly addresses the issue described.\n\nPlease explain your reasoning and choose one of the following labels based on your evaluation:\n\nCORRECT_AND_PRECISE: The patch addresses the described issue without unnecessary changes.\n\nCORRECT_BUT_INCOMPLETE: The patch addresses the described issue but may fail to catch certain edge cases.\n\nBROAD_MISSING_KEY_ASPECTS: The patch misses some key aspects described in the issue or makes additional unrelated changes that are irrelevant to the issue.\n\nINCORRECT: The patch fails to address the issue or fundamentally misunderstands the requirements.\n\nPatches labeled BROAD_MISSING_KEY_ASPECTS or INCORRECT are considered insufficient and will be discarded.\n\n<PATCH>\ndiff --git a/src/_pytest/unittest.py b/src/_pytest/unittest.py\nindex 719eb4e88..2a2d8437d 100644\n--- a/src/_pytest/unittest.py\n+++ b/src/_pytest/unittest.py\n@@ -144,7 +144,8 @@ def _make_xunit_fixture(\n         scope=scope,\n         autouse=True,\n         # Use a unique name to speed up lookup.\n-        name=f\"unittest_{setup_name}_fixture_{obj.__qualname__}\",\n+        # Name starts with underscore to make it \"private\" and only show up with -v\n+        name=f\"_unittest_{setup_name}_fixture_{obj.__qualname__}\",\n     )\n     def fixture(self, request: FixtureRequest) -> Generator[None, None, None]:\n         if _is_skipped(self):\n\n</PATCH>\n\nDoes this patch correctly address the issue described below?\n\n<ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\nStarting v6.2.0, unittest setUpClass fixtures are no longer \"private\"\n<!--\r\nThanks for submitting an issue!\r\n\r\nQuick check-list while reporting bugs:\r\n-->\r\nMinimal example:\r\n```\r\nimport unittest\r\n\r\nclass Tests(unittest.TestCase):\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def setUpClass(cls):\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    def test_1(self):\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n```\r\n~$  pytest --fixtures\r\n...\r\nunittest_setUpClass_fixture_Tests [class scope] -- ../Platform/.venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/_pytest/unittest.py:145\r\n    /home/ubuntu/src/Platform/.venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/_pytest/unittest.py:145: no docstring available\r\n```\r\nThe expected (and previously implemented behavior) is that this fixture's name would start with an underscore, and would therefore only get printed if the additional `-v` flag was used. As it stands, I don't see a way to hide such generated fixtures which will not have a docstring.\r\n\r\nThis breaks a code-quality CI script that makes sure we don't have undocumented pytest fixtures (and the code-base has many legacy tests that use unittest, and that will not get upgraded).\r\n\n\n</ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\n\nPlease first provide a concise reasoning for your classification, and then clearly state your classification in the format: <EXPLANATION>reasoning</EXPLANATION><LABEL>label</LABEL>."
