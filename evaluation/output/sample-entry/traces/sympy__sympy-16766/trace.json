It produces valid Python indexing syntax (`base[index, \u2026]`) and makes only the minimal change necessary. No unrelated code is altered, and it cleanly suppresses the \u201cNot supported\u201d warning for `Indexed`. Therefore it correctly and precisely addresses the issue.\n</EXPLANATION>\n<LABEL>CORRECT_AND_PRECISE</LABEL>",
