The issue seems to be that the server's initial 301 response has a header falsely claiming that the response body (a simple HTML page) is gzipped, when it's actually uncompressed.\n\nWhen resolving redirects, Requests does (in `requests.sessions.resolve_redirects`):\n\n```\nresp.content  # Consume socket so it can be released\n```\n\nwhich attempts to decode\n\nOne could legitimately say this is the server's problem. However, conceptually, why decode the response body of a redirect, which won't get returned? Other programs (Chromium, Firefox, `curl`) don't do this. For example, `curl` gives an error, as expected, when not following redirects:\n\n```\n$ curl --compressed 'http://www.whatbird.com/forum/index.php?/gallery/image/291517-foo/'\ncurl: (61) Error while processing content unencoding: invalid code lengths set\n```\n\nwhereas it works if you add the `--location` flag (follow redirects).\n# Example of error\n\n```\nPython 3.3.2+ (default, Oct  9 2013, 14:56:03) \n[GCC 4.8.1] on linux\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import requests ; requests.get('http://www.whatbird.com/forum/index.php?/gallery/image/291517-foo/')\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"./requests/packages/urllib3/response.py\", line 199, in read\n    data = self._decoder.decompress(data)\nzlib.error: Error -3 while decompressing data: incorrect header check\n\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"./requests/models.py\", line 629, in generate\n    for chunk in self.raw.stream(chunk_size, decode_content=True):\n  File \"./requests/packages/urllib3/response.py\", line 236, in stream\n    data = self.read(amt=amt, decode_content=decode_content)\n  File \"./requests/packages/urllib3/response.py\", line 204, in read\n    e)\nrequests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError: ('Received response with content-encoding: gzip, but failed to decode it.', error('Error -3 while decompressing data: incorrect header check',))\n\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"./requests/api.py\", line 55, in get\n    return request('get', url, **kwargs)\n  File \"./requests/api.py\", line 44, in request\n    return session.request(method=method, url=url, **kwargs)\n  File \"./requests/sessions.py\", line 393, in request\n    resp = self.send(prep, **send_kwargs)\n  File \"./requests/sessions.py\", line 496, in send\n    r = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)\n  File \"./requests/adapters.py\", line 391, in send\n    r.content\n  File \"./requests/models.py\", line 691, in content\n    self._content = bytes().join(self.iter_content(CONTENT_CHUNK_SIZE)) or bytes()\n  File \"./requests/models.py\", line 634, in generate\n    raise ContentDecodingError(e)\nrequests.exceptions.ContentDecodingError: ('Received response with content-encoding: gzip, but failed to decode it.', error('Error -3 while decompressing data: incorrect header check',))\n```\n\n\n</ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\n\nPlease first provide a concise reasoning for your classification, and then clearly state your classification in the format: <EXPLANATION>reasoning</EXPLANATION><LABEL>label</LABEL>."
