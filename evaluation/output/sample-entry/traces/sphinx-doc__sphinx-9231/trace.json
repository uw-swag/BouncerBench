This is a serious problem for Linux distributions that will end up with misplaced and unusable man pages. Please consider keeping it disabled by default; the benefit of being able to use MANPATH in the output directory does not justify this kind of breakage.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that the current implementation generates paths like `<builddir>/1` instead of `<builddir>/man1`. Only the latter can be used with MANPATH which appears to be the main motivation behind #7996.\r\n\r\nExamples of breakage I've seen so far (and we've only had sphinx 4.0.x in Arch Linux for three days):\r\n\r\n[fish-shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) does not expect the section subdirectory and results in man pages for built-in shell commands being installed to `usr/share/fish/man/man1/1` instead of `usr/share/fish/man/man1` and also fails to filter out `fish.1`, `fish_indent.1` and `fish_key_reader.1` which are meant to be installed to `usr/share/man/man1`.\r\n\r\n[llvm-project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) copies the output directory to `usr/share/man/man1` resulting in paths like `usr/share/man/man1/1/foo.1` (note the additional `1` directory).\n\n</ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\n\nPlease first provide a concise reasoning for your classification, and then clearly state your classification in the format: <EXPLANATION>reasoning</EXPLANATION><LABEL>label</LABEL>."

It completely omits fixing the namespace for section folders\u2014i.e. generating `man1`, `man2`, etc., rather than plain `1`, `2`\u2014which was highlighted as a second key aspect.
