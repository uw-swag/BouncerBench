In the example the choices are separated by `|`, not commas, and the existing code already escapes `|` to `\\textbar{}` without adding an `\\allowbreak`, so there are still no permissible break points between the alternatives. Thus it fails to fully resolve the overflow issue.</EXPLANATION><LABEL>BROAD_MISSING_KEY_ASPECTS</LABEL>",
