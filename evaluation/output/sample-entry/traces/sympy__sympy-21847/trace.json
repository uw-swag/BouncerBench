Replacing it with `min_degree <= sum(powers.values()) <= max_degree` correctly enforces the total degree bounds. The patch applies this fix in both the commutative and non\u2010commutative branches and doesn\u2019t introduce unrelated changes to the core logic. Therefore it precisely addresses the issue.</EXPLANATION><LABEL>CORRECT_AND_PRECISE</LABEL>",
