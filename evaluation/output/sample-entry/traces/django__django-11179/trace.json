The patch injects \u201csetattr(instance, model._meta.pk.attname, None)\u201d immediately after performing the fast-delete, which correctly nulls out the attribute backing instance.pk. It\u2019s minimal, hits exactly the fast-delete branch, and uses the field\u2019s attname so it works for any PK field name.
