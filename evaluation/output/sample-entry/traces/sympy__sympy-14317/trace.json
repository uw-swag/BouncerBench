Feeding a list into the LaTeX printer will not produce the correct summed expression (and there\u2019s no handling for lists), so the output will be wrong. A proper fix would reassemble the ordered terms into an `Add` (e.g. `Add(*poly.as_ordered_terms())`) before printing. As given, the patch misunderstands the requirements and produces incorrect output.</EXPLANATION><LABEL>INCORRECT</LABEL>",
