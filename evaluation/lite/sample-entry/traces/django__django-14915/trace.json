In my code, I add custom data-* attributes to the select widget options. After the upgrade some of those options broke. Error is {TypeError}unhashable type: 'ModelChoiceIteratorValue'.\nExample (this one breaks):\n\tdef create_option(self, name, value, label, selected, index, subindex=None, attrs=None):\n\t\tcontext = super().create_option(name, value, label, selected, index, subindex, attrs)\n\t\tif not value:\n\t\t\treturn context\n\t\tif value in self.show_fields: # This is a dict {1: ['first_name', 'last_name']}\n\t\t\tcontext['attrs']['data-fields'] = json.dumps(self.show_fields[value])\nHowever, working with arrays is not an issue:\n\tdef create_option(self, name, value, label, selected, index, subindex=None, attrs=None):\n\t\tcontext = super().create_option(name, value, label, selected, index, subindex, attrs)\n\t\tif not value:\n\t\t\treturn context\n\t\tif value in allowed_values: # This is an array [1, 2]\n\t\t\t...\n\n</ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\n\nPlease first provide a concise reasoning for your classification, and then clearly state your classification in the format: <EXPLANATION>reasoning</EXPLANATION><LABEL>label</LABEL>."
