That exactly fixes the reported wrong behavior for `exp(u/v)` (where `u/v` is dimensionless) without touching any unrelated code paths. The change is minimal, addresses the issue at its root, and doesn\u2019t inject extraneous modifications. The generic \u201conly allow functions on dimensionless inputs\u201d policy matches the intent of the units system for mathematical functions. Hence this correctly and precisely fixes the bug.</EXPLANATION><LABEL>CORRECT_AND_PRECISE</LABEL>",
