Here comes the real data:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pipenv run python3 -m requests.help\r\n{\r\n  \"chardet\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"3.0.4\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"cryptography\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"idna\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"2.7\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"implementation\": {\r\n    \"name\": \"CPython\",\r\n    \"version\": \"3.6.8+\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"platform\": {\r\n    \"release\": \"4.15.0-43-generic\",\r\n    \"system\": \"Linux\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"pyOpenSSL\": {\r\n    \"openssl_version\": \"\",\r\n    \"version\": null\r\n  },\r\n  \"requests\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"2.21.0\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"system_ssl\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"1000207f\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"urllib3\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"1.24\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"using_pyopenssl\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for looking into this!\r\n\n\n</ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\n\nPlease first provide a concise reasoning for your classification, and then clearly state your classification in the format: <EXPLANATION>reasoning</EXPLANATION><LABEL>label</LABEL>."
