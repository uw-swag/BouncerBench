The patch simply checks for that case and returns an empty dict instead of indexing out of range. It does not affect the normal cases (when x is an array or both x and y are arrays) and doesn\u2019t introduce any unrelated changes. Thus it precisely fixes the one-off error without overreaching.\n</EXPLANATION>\n<LABEL>CORRECT_AND_PRECISE</LABEL>",
