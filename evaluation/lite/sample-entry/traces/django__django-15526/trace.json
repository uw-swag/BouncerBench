This lead to custom admin sites using the default admin to redirect via `view_on_site.\nThis is clearly a bug. When the default admin is handled with extra protections outside of Django (e.g. additional basic auth), users of the custom admin cannot use the \"view on site\" link because it routes through the default admin.\nPatch is easy and already here: \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/15526\nI'll try to provide a regression test as well.\n\n</ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\n\nPlease first provide a concise reasoning for your classification, and then clearly state your classification in the format: <EXPLANATION>reasoning</EXPLANATION><LABEL>label</LABEL>."
